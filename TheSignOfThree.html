            <span>T</span>he Sign of Three started as the last episode finished:
            badly. The first third of the episode was awful and the second third
            poor, but the last part returned to the exciting, fast paced and
            intelligent drama that made Sherlock so good in the first place. The
            show seems to have lost its way during the two year break between
            series two and three, and I’d like to take a look at what’s gone
            wrong. The episode spun around John’s wedding to Mary Morstan,
            climaxing with the reveal that two recent cases Sherlock had been
            working on were linked to a plan to kill John’s former army
            commander during the reception. Sherlock solved the case before
            disappearing into the night, leaving John and his new wife with the
            knowledge that a third Watson would soon be on the way. Too much of
            the episode was given over to broad comedy. Sherlock is not a
            sitcom; it’s a drama with comedy elements. The show works best when
            it builds jokes into the dialogue, humanising the characters and
            providing some relief from the often scary drama. This episode
            though started like a jokey sitcom about the awkward but loveable
            Sherlock. At one point, Sherlock interrogated the wedding party,
            which is something I could see him doing, completely unaware of how
            inappropriate it would seem, but the scene crossed a line into
            ridiculous camp. ‘Do you have anything to say in your defence,’ he
            asked Mary’s ex-boyfriend. That’s the type of punchline a sitcom
            character – The Big Bang Theory’s Sheldon Cooper maybe – would say,
            with a laugh-track over the top. The Sherlock of this series is too
            different from the character in previous series; jokey and playful,
            not aloof or arrogant enough. At one point, Mary manipulated
            Sherlock into taking a case in order to assuage his wedding nerves.
            So Sherlock is now someone who can be fooled by an ordinary person?
            She even gives a thumbs up to both John and Sherlock at the same
            time, without the latter noticing. This is the same guy who is so
            perceptive he can tell that someone is having an affair by the state
            of their clothes alone. It’s okay – indeed necessary – for a
            character to change over time, but some of these changes are
            occurring too fast, without proper motivation, or are contradictory
            to Sherlock’s core attributes i.e. his incredible intelligence. A
            lot of this episode focused on Sherlock’s idiosyncrasies and
            people’s reaction to them, such as a strange series of flashbacks
            showing characters appalled at the idea of Sherlock giving a best
            man speech. I think the Sherlock writers have fallen in love with
            their character a little too much. Or maybe they are playing to the
            gallery. The Guardian’s TV critic Mark Lawson wrote a great article
            about the show, arguing that it risks becoming skewed towards an
            audience of obsessive fans who are in love with Sherlock and his
            quirks. It’s becoming professional fanfiction, bordering on
            self-parody.
          </p>

            It’s not a coincidence that the episode improved once it started
            focusing on plot: the cases Sherlock and John investigated. The
            scene with Sherlock surrounded by the women from one case, trying to
            work out the connection between them all – making mistakes along the
            way – was a return to what this show used to be about: Sherlock’s
            intelligence, smart screenwriting and innovative directing,
            production and editing. This second act still wandered into bad
            comedy territory – Sherlock and John’s drunken adventures went on
            way too long – but it was certainly better than the first.

          Things really kicked in though once Sherlock realised mid-speech that
          his recent cases were linked to the wedding. This was the show in its
          element: Sherlock smarter than everyone else, pacing the room, trying
          to connect all the pieces and work out which wedding guest was the
          intended victim and which was the murderer. Sherlock is best when it
          is doing this, because in amongst all the excitement and drama there
          is still room for jokes and character insight. As Sherlock struggled
          to work out how to stop the major being killed, John pointed out that
          Sherlock should be able to solve the case now there was pressure on
          him to do so. ‘You are not a puzzle solver – you never have been;
          you’re a drama queen,’ he shouted. Later Sherlock stopped the major
          from killing himself by alluding to their similar status in John’s
          life: ‘Not at John’s wedding,’ he said. ‘We wouldn’t, would we? You
          and me. We wouldn’t do that to John Watson.’
