            >’d taken <u>Sherlock</u> out Christmas shopping which, looking
            back, wasn’t the best of ideas. He’d shouted at a Father Christmas
            that he was bored and wanted a nice juicy murder for Christmas - in
            front of a bunch of kids and their parents. Escorted back to the
            flat by the police, we found a student, Sally Barnicot, waiting for
            us. After Sherlock had managed to insult her about her looks and the
            way she was dressed, she told us about a murder that had taken place
            at her university. Pietro Venucci, an art student, and Sally’s best
            friend had been found stabbed in the pottery room. His boyfriend,
            Beppo Rovito, was discovered next to the body and told the police
            that he’d just discovered him.

            A smashed window seemed to confirm that someone had broken in and as
            there was no knife on Beppo or in the room, he’d been released from
            custody. Sally was convinced that Beppo did it as he and Pietro had
            had a fiery relationship. It didn’t take Sherlock Holmes to work out
            that she’d also been in love with Pietro. Sherlock was instantly on
            the internet and was thrilled to discover that there had been a
            number of burglaries at houses belonging to a couple of students, a
            lecturer and a friend of the victim. He had, of course, already
            worked it all out. Sherlock requested, or rather ordered, me to go
            to the university, pretending to be a curator from the Hickman
            Gallery. I told the art lecturer, Horace Harker, that I was
            interested in displaying some students’ work - especially pieces of
            sculpture. Naturally, the murder came up in conversation and I asked
            if the victim had been working on anything in particular as we could
            display it as a nice tribute to him. Harker said that Pietro had
            made six pottery figures of Maggie Thatcher before he died. They
            were like those ones you see of Princess Diana advertised in
            magazines only they had devil horns. This was satire, apparently.
            The figures, Harker told me sadly, had already been taken.

          We went to visit the people who’d been burgled and it turns out that
          they’d all bought one of the Thatcher figures. Nothing else had been
          taken during the break-ins which, again, was what Sherlock had
          expected to hear. We found the addresses of the people who owned the
          remaining two figures and contacted them. That night, I took one
          address and Sherlock the other. I sat there, in the dark and waited.
          Then, hearing the sound of a window breaking, I hid. I watched as
          Beppo broke in and found the figure on the mantlepiece. I followed him
          outside and called Sherlock who joined me. We followed him to a bridge
          and watched as he smashed the figure to the ground. Something was
          inside it which he picked up, ready to throw in the river. Before he
          could, we stopped him and found that he was holding a penknife with
          his initials on it. Knowing that it was all over, he confessed
          immediately. He and Pietro had had an argument and, in a struggle,
          Beppo had stabbed him. He’d seen the figures were about to go into the
          oven and had pushed the knife into the clay. He’d then smashed a
          window to make it look like there’d been a break-in. I thought that
          what he’d done was pretty clever but Sherlock described as
          disappointingly simple. The next day he spent so much time going on
          about how he’d have got away with it that I went to the pub and left
          him talking to a frozen turkey. Oh, and he’s still getting those
          texts.
