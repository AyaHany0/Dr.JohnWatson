            <span>I</span>’ve never been happier to see anyone than I was to see
            Henry Knight. Sherlock had been bored. And trust me, you don’t want
            to be around him when he’s bored. He’s hyperactive, rude, arrogant
            and a real pain in the behind. Yeah I know, same old Sherlock.
            Henry, a normal-looking bloke in his late 20s, was clearly very
            anxious when he arrived at Baker Street. He told us about how,
            twenty years before, his dad had died. He told us how his Dad had
            been ripped apart by the Devil. They’d been out for a walk on
            Dartmoor when they’d been attacked. Some kind of monster - big,
            black with red glowing eyes - had killed his father in front of him.
            Apparently it had taken place near the Government’s Baskerville
            research facility. Sherlock worked out that something must have
            happened the previous night to make Henry suddenly ask for help that
            morning. Henry said that his therapist, Doctor Louise Mortimer, had
            suggested he revisit the location of the attack in order to put old
            ghosts to rest. Henry had done this and, to his horror, had
            discovered some footprints. Footprints that appeared to have been
            made by, what he called, a ‘gigantic hound’. There’d been rumours
            that experiments on animals had been taking place at the Baskerville
            facility since WWII. And so, Sherlock took the case and off we went
            into deepest, darkest Devon.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then went to see Henry at his home where he told us that
            something else had come back to him about the night his father died
            - two words: Liberty and In. Sherlock then announced his next move -
            we’d take Henry up to the moors that night and see if anything else
            attacked him. I’m not sure who was more worried about this, me or
            Henry. Turns out we were both right to be worried. That night, I
            heard the hound. Well, I heard something. The place was so bleak and
            desolate but I was sure it wasn’t my mind playing tricks on me. But
            it got worse - Sherlock and Henry saw it. Sherlock denied it at
            first, but back at the pub he finally admitted to me that he’d seen
            it. I’ve never seen him so shaken, so scared. He was actually
            terrified. We parted company and I went to interview Louise
            Mortimer, Henry’s therapist. She was starting to open up to me when
            Frankland arrived, interrupting us. Things weren’t going well.

          The next morning, I met up with Sherlock and we discussed the previous
          evening. He admitted that as well as fear, the worst thing he’d felt
          was doubt. He’d never doubted himself before and he simply couldn’t
          understand how he’d seen what he’d seen. Luckily, I’d already spotted
          a clue. A receipt for meat at the vegetarian hotel and restaurant we
          were staying at. When confronted, the owners admitted that they’d
          bought a dog to help cash in on the rising tourist trade but that
          they’d had it put down some time before. It certainly hadn’t been what
          Sherlock had seen the previous night. And therefore it certainly
          wasn’t what I was about to see. We returned to the base to talk to
          Doctor Stapleton. Before meeting up with her, though, Sherlock sent me
          off to look for any sign of this 'monster’ , so i started in the main
          lab. And I was trapped when it came for me it. I could hear it… And
          then I saw it… I’ve been through some terrifying experiences in my
          life but that was one of the worst. Something that just seemed so
          unbelievable and so unstoppable… Those eyes… And then Sherlock rescued
          me and revealed that I’d been drugged. I saw the hound because that’s
          what I’d expected to see. Obviously, as a doctor, I’ve seen the
          effects of a number of different drugs but this… I hadn’t just seen
          the hound. I’d heard it. I’d felt it getting closer. I’d felt the fear
          inside me… We met up with Stapleton again and, in her lab, Sherlock
          examined some sugar from Henry’s house. He’d noticed that both and he
          and Henry took sugar in their coffee which would explain why they’d
          seen the hound the previous night and I hadn’t. It also explained why
          Sherlock had made me coffee that morning and put sugar in it. He’d
          used me as an experiment. One day, I will kill him. There was one
          thing that had bothered Sherlock from the start and that was Henry’s
          use of the word 'hound’. It was an odd word, old-fashioned. He
          wondered whether it was another piece of his memory trying to break
          through and whether it was actually an acronym he’d seen. Using the
          facility’s computers, we managed to discover the existence of an old
          scientific project, indeed known as H.O.U.N.D. The project had been to
          design and develop a weapon that could create fear in the enemy. It
          had been closed down when they’d realised that prolonged exposure had
          caused people to lose their sanity. And where had the project been
          developed? Liberty, Indiana. Liberty. In. Henry had been remembering
          things! Then his therapist, Louise, called. Henry had lost it. He’d
          turned a gun on her and fled. She was all right but she was scared
          about what he might do to himself. We returned to the moors, to the
          place where Henry’s dad had been killed and there he was. He was close
          to killing himself. His mind just couldn’t cope with all the
          conflicting information - what he remembered, what he thought he
          remembered, everything. Sherlock knew that he’d started to remember
          that it had actually been a man who had killed his father and not a
          monster. Witnessing this as a kid, he’d tried to rationalise it into
          something different. He’d created the hound out of the various images
          he’d seen - the crazed man and the acronym which his father’s murderer
          had been wearing on a sweatshirt. H.O.U.N.D. And then we all saw the
          hound again. It was coming for us. I knew, I rationalised that it
          wasn’t real, that I was just seeing things but it was there… Coming
          for us… And so was the man behind it all. Doctor Frankland. He was
          wearing a gasmask which told Sherlock what he needed to know - the
          poison, the weapon that H.O.U.N.D. had created hadn’t been in the
          sugar. It was in the fog! We were in a chemical minefield. As the
          hound prepared to attack, we shot it and we saw that it was just a
          dog. And then Sherlock did one of the most human things I think I’ve
          ever seen him do - he made Henry look at the dog’s body. He didn’t
          need to, he’d solved the case but it was as if he knew that the truly
          important thing was showing Henry what was real and what wasn’t. Maybe
          the fear and doubt he’d felt, and maybe his experiences with Irene
          Adler, had humanised him? Of course, he immediately started raving on
          in front of Henry about what a fantastic case it had been and I
          realised he hadn’t changed that much. And later, I realised something
          else. Sherlock had thought that the poison was in the sugar at first.
          He’d been convinced . Sherlock had made a mistake. He is only human,
          after all.
