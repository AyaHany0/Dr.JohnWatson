      <span>B</span>y now most of you should be more than aware of the new
      series of Sherlock Holmes stories from Stphen Moffat and Mark Gatiss
      and the BBC. If you’re not, you should be. It is one of the most
      successfully brilliant examples of an updated version of any old
      story- and Sherlock Holmes is OLD- that has come since Stephen
      Spielberg remade Moby Dick in the form of JAWS. One of the marquee
      achievements is in stark evidence via its pilot episode, “A Study in
      Pink” which puts Holmes and Watson together for the first time solving
      their first case of a series of coerced suicides, while also laying
      down the first breadcrumb to Sherlock’s ultimate foe, Moriarty. Moffat
      is a technical watchmaker of a narrative structures. His Rubick’s Cube
      style of story structure that solves itself just in time every time is
      not to be trifled with and regardless of all the various strong
      opinions about him or his work, one cannot discount the sheer
      intellect behind what he makes and writes. Much of the casting remains
      in place with minor changes here and there. All changes are
      improvements as are all reshot scenes. THe former seems like a typical
      low-fi BBC reboot of the infinitely rebootable Sherlock Holmes
      mysteries not really advancing much beyond the setting and modern
      adornments. The final version pushes the entire retelling into deeper
      and more groundbreaking territory. It simply does what it’s former
      twin accomplishes, but triples its import, effect and purpose. I’ve
      gone through and posted here, as you can see, side by side comparisons
      of each of the identical moments where the same dialogue is being
      delivered to compare and contrast the vast differences.

        What makes is relevant here for Muddy Colors, and anyone interested in
        storytelling, is that we have two completed versions of this exact
        episode, both the final aired version amd the unaired “pilot” version
        that preceded it. What makes this such a rare treasure is that both
        were shot from identical scripts, but each by different directors and
        with some essential different narrative approaches that make comparing
        them an incredibly essential case study for how to tell a good story
        and then how to do it better. And the aired pilot is certainly better
        by miles. Being able to witness the first draft and then the changes
        that make the final is an absolutely priceless lesson in how one
        attacks and makes better a story. Whether you write or draw or paint,
        you are making the same kinds of choices any narrative person would by
        rote. Blocking out how and where we see a thing, how we portray it,
        stylize it, present it and from what perspective are all aspects we
        must consider if we’re to make successful stories or art- and always
        both.

        It’s not just Style that shows itself as a value when comparing them
        both, but how flash and effect can be brought into a narrative as a
        tool for driving it and communicating point of view. We see what
        Sherlock sees in words across the objects he observes in the new one
        akin to his love of texting. We feel the almost insect like rapid fire
        thought process from within his character whereas in the first
        version, it’s all observational from the outside. The former may be
        more natural, but as Sherlock is a fairly prickly if not disagreeable
        person, seeing him only from without undermines the essential need to
        empathize with him that getting a brief visual cue to walk in his
        shoes here and there delivers. There are moments of significant change
        to the dialogue- especially in the scene above where Watson’s presence
        is justified by Inspector Lastrade’s refusal to be Sherlock’s
        note-taker- Watson steps in and his purpose is set. In the new version
        Sherlock encourages Watson to go further and examine the body after
        heartily defending his presence for reasons we don’t know. We know
        Sherlock needs him there, but he won’t say why. Watson then proves his
        purpose and underscores value in the room and reenforces this for his
        whole larger purpose in two swift exchanges. Above the first scene the
        woman is an object observed from a distance, in the latter it’s a
        person they come to. We see her from her vantage and humanize her
        where the other objectifies her. Simple stuff of choosing where to put
        the camera like this can mean the world in terms of narrative meaning.

        Here above we see the two new partners discussing how Sherlock managed
        to derive so much supposedly private information from a mere glance.
        In the first we see them in a car with a clumsy greenscreen of the
        city through the rear window behind them as Sherlock ticks off the
        clues. The dialogue remains identical but in the latter, we’re
        constantly in and out of the car at key moments. When out, Watson is
        looking outward as if realizing he’s trapped in a bottle with a scary
        stranger he also admires. he doesn’t look at us pleading for escape,
        and so we are left to leave him where he clearly wishes to be. We get
        a sense of place and motion, of context rather than mere background.
        And all of it delivered by simple visual choices without changing a
        word of script. The latter showcases every image as a considered
        choice. The former leans more on typical and lazy conventions
        delivering words but not fortifying in meaning. The former is like
        1980’s tv still shrugging under its 60 year old vaudevillian heritage,
        the latter is comics done exceptionally well. The changes aren’t just
        the fashion of how they’re shot, they are while watching it unfold
        night and day different despite the near identical script. It is a
        case study in choices and corrections that mirror most editorial
        processes, and reaches well beyond what one editor might do in the
        bay, and what another could bring. Each change is wholly a
        storytelling change. Often one that combines or adds narrative
        purposes to a given scene. Wherein the former may simply show our two
        characters in a setting as below, the second does it but adds the
        narrative element of the window to also show us what SHerlock is
        really there to witness easily and in a way that allows Watson to
        participate.
